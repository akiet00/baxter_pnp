# Baxter Pick and Place
A ROS workspace for Baxter pick and place action. The objects to be picked up must be varied in colors. In addition, Baxter is able to recognize faces through trained facial recognition algorithm and pick a colored object that's associated with that person.

## Requirements
This pick and place variant requires ROS Melodic but ROS Kinetics still works.
